# Plotting scripts
This directory contains scripts used for data analysis and visualization in the TALON manuscript. For R scripts, you can view usage instructions by running `Rscript scriptname.R --h`. For Python scripts, this can be achieved by running `python scriptname.py --h`. Here is a brief guide to the scripts:
